Team Members
Lesedi Shokane - FrontEnd Developer

Project Description
The Simplified Netflix Clone that will allow users to create accounts and login using the Firebase authentication. Users will also be able browse a collection of movies and shows. Users will also be able to stream videos directly on the platform. The project will be focusing on providing a minimal and functional clone of netflix, suitable for practicing key web development skills.

Learning Objectives
Frontend Development: This aims to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, cultivating the needed skills for a future as a Frontend developer.
Backend Development: This part was set up using Firebase services for authentication.
User Interface: I wanted to design a clean and easy to use user interface. Where users can log in browse movies select play and start watching. Also be able to find out information about the type of shows and movies they are watching.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Firebase for authentication and hosting, and adding TV Databases

Challenges
I ran into challenges while setting up the firebase authentication and after multiple trial and error it finally worked. I was also struddling as this is an experience I took on alone to try and see where I was on my journey of learning. Working in a team would have been far more rewarding and less stressful.
Trying to implement a smooth user experience was challenging, trying to make sure the video streaming feature was working. Issues with cross-browser compatibility was also a headache and a half

Future Improvements
Going foward with this clone I would like to add more features like personalized recommendations and a search function which will allow users to search for a particular show and get results. I will also implement payment features for premium content access. I will improve video perfomance like when you hover over a video it starts playing the trailer. Also input a full screen feature for when you play the videos.


Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity to practice frontend web development. Although the platform is simple, it gave me a solid foundation for understanding how real-world streaming services work. In the future, I plan to expand it with more advanced features.
